# lotr_text_analysis

This code is for creating two datasets for Tableau dashboards: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aleksandr.tropin/viz/TheLordoftheRingsTextStatistics/DBLOTRTextAnalysis

I use texts of several Tolkien's books (The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings etc) about Middle-Earth to compare their characteristics and statistics of their characters. Mainly I parsed the texts and calculated book's volumes and frequency of characters' mentions.
